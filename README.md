Dependency resolver for the impatient.

I got really tired of seeing how often this problem was re-solved over and over
every time a new programming language came out, and every time a new package
manager was born. Further, some of those things only created an (often
self-described) half-done solution, something that *sort of* resolved
dependencies, but didn't really. I've also been in situations where I'm solving
a problem as a build engineer and I just need a generic dependency resolver.
So I am building this so that I can use it in my career.

This resolves dependencies and downloads packages for a myriad of packaging
tools. It's nice to have it all together. I'm a devops engineer, and sometimes
when I'm packaging/releasing stuff, I just want to download packages from many
places. Sometimes the package manager is broken, or sometimes the actual
package specified dependencies incorrectly, and I'd like to override these
problems from the resolver side.

# Motivation

# Contribution Guidelines

All pull requests (PRs) welcome, but subject to whether it's a
good change; however, PRs will rarely be denied if:
- Someone seconds your idea
- The test code coverage of any code added by your PR does not fall below 75%
- The test code coverage of the project as a whole does not fall below 75%

# Code of Conduct

I strive to maintain an open and safe environment for contribution. There are a
lot of people out there with a lot of opinions and philosophies.  Therefore, as
a rule, any discussion, pull request, feature request, bug report, or other
contribution, made in part or as a whole with the apparent purpose of talking
about, criticizing, or affecting anything but what the code should be and how
it should behave is at best off topic, and at worst offensive to somebody. I
reserve the right to delete any comments or block PRs if those contributions
are hurting someone's feelings through blatant attack or insensitivity.

* Also:
  - Be nice.
  - When someone implements a feature or fixes a bug, please thank them.
  - When a bug or feature has not received attention in a long time, please be
    patient and forgiving.
  - When someone disagrees with you, that's okay.
  - Remember that we are all real people.
