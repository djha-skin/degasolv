# degasolv

Dependency resolver with an eye toward building software.

I got really tired of seeing how often this problem was re-solved over
and over every time a new programming language came out, and every
time a new package manager was born. I ended up writing this application.

When finished, it will be a dependency resolver that will work across
programming language boundaries, customizable to fit the needs of
build engineers who are just trying to get their software built.
